# UmbrellaRL

## Generic solution for reinforcement learning problems ☂️

Version 1.0.0 will be a full tabular solution method release. See below for currently implemented & planned features.

UmbrellaRL is intended to ease some of the requirements for working with reinforcement learning problems. By providing logic & mathematics, the UmbrellaRL agent only requires an environment to interact with.
This allows for faster solution methods to reinforcement learning problems.
